    <h1>Basic Component of Computer</h1>
    <p>Components of Computer refer to physical and the non-physical part of the system. A computer system can be divided into <b>hardware, software and humanware</b></p>
    <h2>The Hardware</h2>
    <p>The hardware refers to the physical components and the devices which make up the visible computer. It can be divided into two: <b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> and the <b>Peripherals.</b>  The CPU is responsible for all processing that the computer does while the peripherals are responsible for feeding data into the system and for collecting information from the system.  </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>The CPU consists of <b>Main storage,</b> <b>ALU</b> and <b>Control Unit</b>.  The main storage is used for storing data to be processed as well as the instructions for processing them.  The ALU is the unit for arithmetic and logical operations.  The control unit ensures the smooth operation of the other hardware units.  It fetches instruction, decode (interprets) the instruction and issues commands to the units responsible for executing the instructions. </p>
    <p>The peripherals are in three categories: <b>Input devices,</b> <b>Output devices</b> and <b>auxiliary storage devices.</b>  </p>
    <p>The <b>input device</b> is used for supplying data and instructions to the computer. Examples are terminal Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, Microphone, Scanner, Webcam, etc.  </p>
    <p><b>Output device</b> is used for obtaining result (information) from the computer. Examples are Printers, Video Display Unit (VDU), loudspeaker, projector etc, </p>
    <p><b>Auxiliary Storage Devices</b> are used for storing information on a long-term basis. Examples are hard disk, flash disk, magnetic tape, memory card, solid state drive SDD etc</p>

    <p>A simple model of the hardware part of a computer system is shown below:</p>
    <h1 class="main"><img src="cpu.jpg" alt=""></h1>
    <h5>Hardware part of a computer system</h5>

    <p></p>
    <h2>The Software</h2>
    <div class="pex">
    <p><b>Software</b> are basically referred to as programs. A program consists of sequence of instructions required to accomplish well-defined tasks.  Examples of such tasks include:</p>
    <p>1.	Finding the average score of a student</p>
       <p> 2.	Computing the net pay of an employee</p>
       <p> 3.	Solving a set of simultaneous linear equations</p>
        
    </div>
    <p>It is the software that enables the hardware to be put into effective use. There are two main categories of software – <b>System software</b> and <b>Application software.</b></p>
    <h2>System Software</h2>
    <p><b>System software</b> are programs commonly written by computer manufacturers, which have direct effect on the control, performance and ease of usage of the computer system.  Examples are Operating System, Language Translators, Utilities and Service Programs, and Database Management Systems (DBMS).</p>
    <p><b>Operating System</b> is a collection of program modules which form an interface between the computer hardware and the computer user.  Its main function is to ensure a judicious and efficient utilization of all the system resources (such as the processor, memory, peripherals and other system data) as well as to provide programming convenience for the user.  Examples are Unix, Linux, Windows, Macintosh, and Disk Operating system.</p>
    <p><b>Language Translators</b> are programs which translate programs written in non-machine languages such as FORTRAN, C, Pascal, and BASIC into the machine language equivalent. Example of language translators are assemblers, interpreters, compilers and preprocessor</p>
    <ul class="big">
        <li><b>Assemblers:</b> This is a program that converts program written in assembly language (low level language) into machine language equivalent
        </li>
        <li><b>Interpreter:</b> This is a program that converts program written in high level language (HLL) into its machine language (ML) equivalent one line at a time. Language like BASIC is normally interpreted. </li>
        <li><b>Compiler:</b> This is a program that translates program written in high level language (HLL) into machine language (ML) equivalent all at once. Compilers are normally called by the names of the high-level language they translate. For instance, COBOL compiler, FORTRAN compiler etc.</li>
        <li><b>Preprocessor:</b> This is a language translator that takes a program in one HLL and produces equivalent program in another HLL. For example, there are many preprocessors to map structured version of FORTRAN into conventional FORTRAN.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Database Management System (DBMS)</b> is a complex program that is used for creation, storage, retrieving, securing and maintenance of a database.  A database can be described as an organized collection of related data relevant to the operations of a particular organization.  The data are stored usually in a central location and can be accessed by different authorized users.</p>
    <p><b>Linker</b> is a program that takes several object files and libraries as input and produces one executable object file.</p>
    <p><b>Loader</b> is a program that places an executable object file into memory and makes them ready for execution. Both linker and loader are provided by the operating system.</p>
    <p><b>Utility and Service Programs:</b> These are programs which provide facilities for performing common computing tasks of a routine nature. The following are some of the examples of commonly used utility programs:</p>
    <ul class="big">
        <li><b>Sort Utility:</b> This is used for arranging records of a file in a specified sequence (alphabetic, numerical or chronological) of a particular data item within the records. The data item is referred to as the sort key.
        </li>
        <li><b>Merge Utility:</b> This is used to combine two or more already ordered files together to produce a single file.</li>
        <li><b>Copy Utility:</b> This is used mainly for transferring data from a storage medium to the other, for example from disk to tape.</li>
        <li><b>Debugging Facilities:</b> These are used for detecting and correcting errors in program.</li>
        <li><b>Text Editors:</b> These provide facilities for creation and amendment of program from the terminal.</li>
        <li><b>Benchmark Program:</b> This is a standardized collection of programs that are used to evaluate hardware and software. For example, a benchmark might be used to compare the performance of two different computers on identical tasks, assess the comparative performance of two operating systems etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Application Software</h2>
    <p>These are programs written by a user to solve individual application problem. They do not have any effect on the efficiency of the computer system. An example is a program to calculate the grade point average of all the 100L students.  Application software can be divided into two namely: Application Package and User’s Application Program. When application programs are written in a very generalized and standardized nature such that they can be adopted by a number of different organizations or persons to solve similar problem, they are called Application Packages. There are a number of micro-computer based packages. These include word processors (such as Ms-word, WordPerfect, WordStar); Database packages (such as Oracle, Ms-access, Sybase, SQL Server, and Informix); Spreadsheet packages (such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Ms-Excel); Graphic packages (such as CorelDraw, Fireworks, Photoshop etc), and Statistical packages (such as SPSS). User’s Application Program is a program written by the user to solve specific problem which is not generalized in nature. Examples include writing a program to find the roots of quadratic equation, payroll application program, and program to compute students’ results.</p>
    <h2>The Human-ware</h2>
    <p>Although, the computer system is automatic in the sense that once initiated, it can, without human intervention, continue to work on its own under the control of stored sequence of instructions (program), however, it is not automatic in the sense that it has to be initiated by a human being, and the instructions specifying the operations to be carried out on the input data are given by human being.  Therefore, apart from the hardware and software, the third element that can be identified in a computer system is the <b>human-ware.</b>  This term refers to the people that work with the computer system. The components of the human-ware in a computer system include the system analyst, the programmer, data entry operator, end users etc.</p>
    <h1>Organizational Structure of a Typical Computer Installation</h1>
    <p>The following diagram shows the organizational structure of a typical computer installation</p>
    <h1 class="main"><img src="structure.png" alt=""></h1>
    <h5>Organizational Structure of a typical computer installation</h5>
    <p><b>Data Processing Manager (DPM)</b> supervises every other persons that work with him and is answerable directly to the management of the organization in which he works.</p>
    <p><b>A System Analyst</b> is a person that understudies an existing system in operation in order to ascertain whether or not computerization of the system is necessary and/or cost-effective.  When found necessary, he designs a computerized procedure and specifies the functions of the various programs needed to implement the system.</p>
    <p><b>A Programmer</b> is the person that writes the sequence of instructions to be carried out by the computer in order to accomplish a well-defined task. The instructions are given in computer programming languages.</p>
    <p><b>A data entry operator</b> is the person that enters data into the system via keyboard or any input device attached to a terminal. There are other ancillary staffs that perform other functions such as controlling access to the computer room, controlling the flow of jobs in and out of the computer room.</p>
    <p><b>An end-user</b> is one for whom a computerized system is being implemented. The end-user interacts with the computerized system in their day-to-day operations of the organization. For example a cashier in the bank who receives cash from customers or pays money to customers interacts with the banking information system.</p>
