    <h1> Computer Classifications </h1>
    <p> Computer can be classified into various forms because of the complexity and diversification in its application. Four basic classifications will be adopted. These are classification according to generations, classification according to Nature of Data, classification according to size and classification according to purpose
    </p>
    <h2>Classification by Generation</h2>
    <p>There are five basic generations to which computer can be classified based on year and components.</p>
    <p>
       <b>	First Generation Computer:</b> These were the early computers that were manufactured in 1940 and lasted till 1956. The first generation computers were characterized with the use of vacuum tubes as its major components. These vacuum tubes generate enormous heat and consume much electricity. The first generation computers introduce the concept of stored programs. Exclusively, computer experts can program the computer only in machine language, which makes it programmable. Examples are UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer), ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) etc.
    </p>
    <h1 class="main"><img src="first gen.jpg" alt=""></h1>
    <h5>UNIVAC I supervisory control console</h5>

    <p><b>Second Generation Computer:</b> These were the set of computers that succeeded the first generation computers. Their advent was from 1956 and lasted until 1963. The components of the second generation of computer were built around transistors which replaces the vacuum tube in the first generation. The resultant effect of the transistors in place of vacuum tube is reduction in size compared with first generation computers, less power consumption, generation of less heat and improved storage facility due to introduction of magnetic devices for storage medium. The overall effects are the improved reliability and introduction of symbolic languages for programming. Examples are ATLAS, IBM 1400 series (International business Machine), PDP I & II (Programmed Data Processor I & II) etc.</p>
    <h1 class="main"><img src="second gen.jpg" alt=""></h1>
    <h5>Second Generation Computer</h5>
    <p><b>Third Generation Computer:</b> This generation of computer succeeded the second generation computers. The advent of this generation was between 1964 to late 1971. Due to the technological advancement that had taken place in the industrial sector which makes many transistors to be coupled into a single unit component. Hence, the major component that characterized the third generation computer is the Integrated Circuitry (IC), which is a resultant effect of thousands of transistors combined into a single unit component. The integration of transistors into one component makes the computer smaller in size compare with first and second generation computers, faster machine, consume less power and generate less heat. The concept of multi-programming was introduced in this generation of computers. Programming was made easier by the use of high-level languages. Examples include: IBM 360/370 series, ICL 1900 series (International Computers Limited) etc.</p>
    <h1 class="main"><img src="third gen.jpg" alt=""></h1>
    <h5>Third Generation Computer</h5>

    <p><b>Fourth Generation Computer:</b> The emphasis in the first three generations of computers has been on the development of a computer system that is less expensive, more portable and highly reliable. The fourth generation computers were also developed having in mind the above assertions. These generations of computers were built around Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuitry (VLSI) in which over ten thousand flip-flops were placed in a single silicon chip i.e. thousands of ICs were combined into a single chip. This period witnessed the era of microcomputer with the introduction of microprocessors as its major component. The system came into being in 1971 and still in existence till date. Examples include: IBM, COMPAQ 2000 series, Dell series, Toshiba etc.</p>
    <h1 class="main"><img src="fourth gen.jpg" alt=""></h1>
    <h5>Fourth Generation Computer</h5>
    <p><b>Fifth Generation Computer:</b> The development of the fifth generation computers started in the 1980’s and classical researches are still going on in this generation of computers. It is regarded as present and future of computers. Although, some of these machines are already in use, but a lot of work still need to be done to actualize the reasons for this generation of computer. The objective of this computer system is to build a computer system that mimic the intelligence of human expert in a knowledge domain such as medicine, law, education, criminal investigation, etc. This objective is achieved through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems development.</p>

    <h2>Classification by Nature of Data</h2>
    <p>There are two types of data the computer can process. They are Digital and Analogue.  Computer types can be classified into three. These are Analogue, Digital and Hybrid computers.</p>
    <p>
        <b>I.	Analogue Computer:</b> This type of computer deals with quantities that are continuously varying. It measures changes in current, temperature or pressure and translates these data into electrical pulses for processing. Examples are speedometer, electric meter, water meter, thermometer etc. 
    </p>
    <p><b>II.	Digital Computer:</b> This operates on data representation in form of discrete values or digits (e.g 0,1,2,3,X,Y,Z,…). They handle numbers discretely and precisely rather than approximately. These types of computers are very common in use both at home and offices. </p>
    <p><b>III.	Hybrid Computer:</b> These types of computers combine the features of both analogue and digital computers. They handle data in both discrete quantity and variable quantities. They are mostly found in industrial processes for data acquisition and data processing purposes. In most cases, analogue signal generated from the analogue computer needs to be converted to digital signal which has to be processed by the digital computer, hence, the need for Analogue-to-Digital Converter and Digital-to-Analogue Converter modulator/demodulator (Modem).</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Classification by Size</h2>
    <p>Computer classifications based on sizes are as follows:</p>
    <p><b>I.	Mainframe Computer:</b> This is a system that has a very powerful Central Processing Unit (CPU) linked by cable to hundreds or thousands of terminals, this system is cable of accepting data simultaneously from all the terminals at the same time. This type of computers are very big and very expensive general-purpose computers with memory capacity more than 100 million bytes and processing power of well above 10 million instructions per second (MIPS). Mainframe computers are used in large organizations such as Banks, Oil companies, big hospitals, airline reservations companies, examination bodies such as WAEC, NECO, JAMB etc. that have very large volumes of data to process which also need to be adequately secured. Examples include ICL 1900 and IBM 360/370 series, IBM 704 etc.</p>
    <p><b>II.	Minicomputer:</b> This type of computer shares similar features with mainframe computer but it is smaller in physical size; generate lower heat, less instruction set and less expensive. It requires the same conditions for its operation like mainframe; such conditions are very cool environment because of the enormous heat being generated, raise or false floor, dust free environment, high-secured office accommodation. Examples of minicomputers are IBM AS/400, NCR Tower 32, DEC System, PDP 7 etc.</p>
    <p><b>III.	Microcomputer:</b> These types of computer are much smaller in size compare to mini and mainframe computers. They are ridiculously cheaper in terms of naira value compare to either mainframe or minicomputer. On these systems, various integrated circuits and elements of computer are replaced by a single integrated circuit called “chip”. Microcomputer was first developed by companies like Apple Computers and later by IBM PC in 1981. It is also called Personal Computer (PC).</p>
    <p><b>IV.	Super Computers:</b> The super computers are extraordinarily powerful computers and they are the largest and fastest computer systems in recent time. They provide high level of accuracy, precision and speed for mathematical computations, meteorological, astronomical and oil exploration applications. In most of the Hollywood’s movies it is used for animation purposes. It is also helpful for forecasting weather reports worldwide. Examples are Cray-1, Cyber series, Fujistu, ETA-10 system. Most of these machines are not available for commercial use.</p>
    <p><b>V.	Notebook Computers:</b> The have small size and low weight. The notebook is easy to carry anywhere. This is easy to carry around and preferred by students and businessmen and women to meet their assignments and other necessary tasks. The approach of this computer is also the same as the personal computer. It is a replacement of personal desktop or microcomputer. Also referred to as laptop. E.g HP 530, Dell etc</p>
    <p>Other types of computers based on size are palmtop and PDA (Personal Digital Assistant).</p>

    <h2>Classification by Purpose</h2>
    <p>There are two classifications to which computer are classified according to its usage or function. These are special purpose and general-purpose computers.</p>
    <p><b>I	Special Purpose Computer:</b> This type of computer is specially developed to perform only one task. The system is highly efficient and economical but lacks flexibility. The program for the machine is built into the machine permanently. Some areas of usage include air traffic control system; military weapons control system, ship navigation system and industrial process controls.</p>
    <p><b>II	General Purpose Computer:</b> These computers have the ability to handle a wide variety of programs and to solve many problems such as payroll, numerical analysis, software development for accounting, inventory system etc. It makes use of stored program for switching from one application to another. </p>
<p>Internet pioneer is regarded as one of the fathers of the internet because he invented an international network which is similar to, but predates that of the Internet. He also discovered mathematical equations that enable the petroleum industry to recover more oil. Emeagwali won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize, computation's Nobel Prize, for inventing a formula that lets computers perform the fastest computations, a work that led to the reinvention of supercomputers.</p>
