    <h1> Basic Computing Concepts </h1>
    <p> A <b>computer</b> can be described as an electronic device that accepts data as input, processes the data based on a set of predefined instructions called program to produce the result of these operations as output called information.  From this description, a computer can be referred to as an Input-Process-Output (IPO) system,pictorially represented in the Figure below

    <h1>Data</h1>
    <p>Data are raw facts, such as a score in examination or the name of a student, for example 55 or Malik respectively.  There are three types of data – Numeric, alphabetic, and alphanumeric.  Numeric data consists of digits 0 – 9 (such as 31), while alphabetic data consist of any of the English language alphabets in upper and lower cases (e. g. Toyin).  An alphanumeric data can consist of a number, an alphabet or a special character, such as a vehicle plate number (e. g. AE 731 LRN).</p>
    <h1>Information</h1>
    <p>Data as described above contain no meaning, however, when it is transformed into a more meaningful and useful form, it is called information. The transformation process involves a series of operations to be performed by the computer on the raw data that are fed into the system.  The operation can be arithmetic (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), logical comparison or character manipulation (as in text processing).</p>
    <h1>Logical</h1>
    <p>Logical comparison means testing whether one data item is greater than, equal to, or less than another item, and based on the outcome of the comparison, a specified action can be taken.  The output of the processing can be in form of reports which can be displayed or printed.</p>
