    <h1>Characteristics of Computers</h1>
    <p>The computer system is characterized by the following:</p>
    <p>I.	Electronic in nature: Data are represented in form of electrical pulses.  The basic component and the operation of computers are electronic, using integrated circuits (ICs).</p>
    <p>II.	Speed: Computers can perform millions of calculations in a few seconds as compared to man who will spend months for doing the same task.</p>
    <p>III.	Accuracy: computers perform tasks with 100% accuracy provided that correct input has been given. It is garbage in garbage out (GIGO) i.e., given accurate input it generates accurate output, and given a wrong input it gives a wrong output.</p>
    <p>IV.	Consistency: that is given the same set of input data, the same result will always be produced</p>
    <p>V.	Iterative: ability to perform repetitive operations without getting bored or fatigued</p>
    <p>VI.	Storage: could store data/information on a long term basis. Variety of data/information such as text, images, audio and video.</p>
    <p>VII.	Automatic control: once initiated, it could operate on its own, without human intervention, under the control of stored sequences of instructions called program</p>
    <p>VIII.	No Feelings: Computer does not have emotions or feelings. Though some robots are now created to have feelings</p>
    <h1>Advantages of Computers</h1>
    <p>The use of computer technology as affected virtually every aspect of life. Although, it has disadvantages, the advantages overweigh the disadvantages. Below are some of the advantages:</p>
    <p><b>I.	Sort, Organize, and Search Information:</b>The computer can use its stored information better than human. Information in the computer can be sorted or organized into different categories. The information can also be searched faster. </p>
    <p><b>II.	Better Understanding of Data:</b>Through different fields of computer technology for example data mining, computers understand data better than humans and can use the information learnt to predict future occurrences to a certain extent. For example, using the database, the computer can predict that at any time bread is sold, eggs or butter or beverage is sold along. This will help the business owner to know that s/he must not run out of eggs or butter or beverage when bread is available for sale</p>
    <p><b>III.	Connection to the Internet:</b>The computer helps to connect to the internet, where choices available are endless once connected. Many advantages of the computer today are through connections to the internet. </p>
    <p><b>IV.	Improves your abilities:</b>The computer can help its user to improve several aspects. For example, use of the spell checker, grammar corrector and so on. The user improves his/her abilities if s/he has a hard time learning. </p>
    <p><b>V.	Assist the physically challenged:</b>Computers are very excellent tools that can be used to help the physically challenged. For example, Speech recognition, where the user gets to type and the computer reads it out. This can help a physically challenged user that cannot speak.  Computers are also great tools for the blind with special software that can be installed to read what is on the screen.</p>
    <p><b>VI.	Entertainment:</b>The computer can keep its user entertained. Different songs, videos, as well as games can be stored on the computer for use.</p>
    <h1>Disadvantages of Computers</h1>
    <p>Though the advantages of computer devices are numerous, there still exit some disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages are:</p>
    <p><b>A.	Attack:</b>Attack can be in form of virus and hacking. Virus usually spread malicious substances on the system while hacking occurs through unauthorized access of the system. </p>
    <p><b>B.	Online Cyber Crimes:</b>Online cyber-crime means computer and network may have been used to commit crime. Cyberstalking and Identity theft are at common cybercrimes of today. </p>
    <p><b>C.	Less Human Interactions:</b>Computers have made it possible for people to work alone on tasks on which they would need to collaborate with others if they were to have to do them manually, such as inputting figures in books of accounts. Therefore, the work environment in offices is such that all workers concentrate on just looking at the computer with little interaction with colleagues. </p>
    <p><b>D.	Reduction in employment opportunity</b></p>
